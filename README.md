MIPS simulations
================

Simulated MIPS disassembler, cache, and pipeline. For educational use only.

If you are using these to help with a homework assignment, please do not 
turn them in as-is. There is at least one mistake in the disassembler. Do 
yourself a favor and use them to help understand the problem you have been 
assigned.
